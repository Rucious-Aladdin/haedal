## **Avicii - Waiting for love**

    Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
    And every night has its day, so magical
    And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
    That can't be defeated

    For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
    In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
    For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
    With something to believe in

    Monday left me broken
    Tuesday, I was through with hoping
    Wednesday, my empty arms were open
    Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

    Thank the stars it's Friday
    I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
    Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
    I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around

    We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
    How did I get so blind and so cynical?
    If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable
    No, we can't be defeated

    Monday left me broken
    Tuesday, I was through with hoping
    Wednesday, my empty arms were open

    Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
    Thank the stars it's Friday
    I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
    Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
    I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
